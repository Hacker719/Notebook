Notebook is a  cool project that I started to help me write more! An online notebook to type notes, thoughts articles, or whatever into, while improving my own JS Web Framework skills! This is really cool because it has CSS animations, uses Next.js, and has light/dark mode!

Feel free to rip off any components! (there are cards and headers!)
